Imagine we find a habitable planet next to our nearest star which wasn’t the sun. That would be Proxima Centauri and it is approximately 4.2 light years away from us. 

**What follows next is a gross oversimplification of space travel.**

If we assume that we could travel through space at a speed of 56,000 km/h, it would take 81,000 years to reach the planet. We of course decide to colonise it but we can’t live for 81,000 years — the current world average life expectancy is 70.5 years. So, let’s assume our next best idea is to go there by using a generational ship. Those aboard will live and die on the ship, giving birth to the next generation along the way until the last generation reaches the planet. 

Would we do it? 

81,000 years is obviously a long time and the first people going aboard the ship are making choices based on their current technology. What if 43,587 years later, those back on earth discover new technologies which allows them to colonise the planet within 20 years. The offspring of those who boarded the generational ship would not reach the planet first, which was the main reason to go. With this in mind, would anyone choose to board the ship in the first place?

These are the kind of issues which exist for companies making investment decisions. Because it takes time for the benefits of investment to show, it can be rendered useless by better, cheaper technology. Could this sort of thinking be discouraging businesses from making investments?

### **Why is investment important?**


Investment is what allows me to write this post on a laptop instead on pen and paper. It’s what allows me to research this topic on the internet instead of sifting through a mountain of books. It’s also what allows you to read this post anywhere without carrying around pieces of paper. Somewhere, sometime ago, someone thought about these new ways of doing things and an investment was made to turn these new methods of doing, into products.

Investment helps raise an economy’s capital stock, which is another way of saying it increases the number of tools we can work with. These new tools and technologies make an impact on our productivity — how much we’re able to get done with the same amount of inputs. This includes investment in education where knowing more allows us to do more or do things in a better way.

As a component of GDP, measuring investment helps us to measure an economy’s output. It’s the most volatile component as the animation below shows — it rises and falls by larger amounts.

This volatile behaviour can be explained by how optimistic firms are about the future and investment decisions being optional. You need to buy food and pay for shelter regularly to sustain yourself but you don’t need to buy a new machinery for your business or learn a certain skill if you think it’s going to be worthless to you. Even if you plan to invest, future outcomes are uncertain. With the gains of investment being realised in the long term, it’s not a surprise that investment activity is sensitive to this uncertainty.

### **What's happening with business investment?**

Both Gross and Net (which takes into account depreciation) investment as a share of GDP reached 14.6% and 4.8% respectively at the peak of the 90s boom. Since then, both are yet to reach similar numbers with average gross and net investment since 2000 being 12.7% and 2.6% respectively. Gross investment has been sluggish in this period but net investment has had a downward trend.
