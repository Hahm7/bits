It seems like every time I check the nextdoor website, there’s a new post about a catalytic converter theft. There would often be footage from security cameras accompanying these posts showing just how well coordinated the thefts are - robbers seem to work in teams of 3 or 4, each with a designated role.

With the number of high street banks <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/2021/12/bank-branch-access-has-shrunk-by-up-to-50--since-2015---but-if-y/" target="_blank">shrinking</a>, it’s starting to feel like cars have become the more attractive item to rob.

### **Is this actually an increasing occurrence?**

To answer this, I scraped the website’s search results for posts mentioning ‘catalytic thefts.’ Nextdoor’s search for posts is not the best as irrelevant results would come up such as posts on bicycle thefts and police events. I also had to watch out for posts mentioning normal car thefts and there were no posts prior to 2020 which came up. After cleaning the data, this was the result.
