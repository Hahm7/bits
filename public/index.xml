      <description>It seems like every time I check the nextdoor website, there’s a new post about a catalytic converter theft. There would often be footage from security cameras accompanying these posts showing just how well coordinated the thefts are - robbers seem to work in teams of 3 or 4, each with a designated role. With the number of high street banks shrinking, have cars replaced them?

      <description>Imagine we find a habitable planet next to our nearest star which wasn’t the sun. That would be Proxima Centauri and it is approximately 4.2 light years away from us.
What follows next is a gross oversimplification of space travel.
If we assume that we could travel through space at a speed of 56,000 km/h, it would take 81,000 years to reach the planet. We of course decide to colonise it but we can’t live for 81,000 years — the current world average life expectancy is 70.</description>

      <description>Since the Trump tax cuts were approved, there’s been an expected fall in tax revenues from corporations but there’s also been a surge in buybacks.
There are claims that companies are foregoing investment and using the extra cash to buyback their shares. Buybacks have been on the rise since they became legal in 1982 and corporate investment has been sluggish as this deloitte article explains:
The general concern is that increasing share buybacks and dividend distribution among nonfinancial corporations is coming at the cost of business investment (which, if undertaken, would lead to long-term gains in productivity and overall economic value).</description>
